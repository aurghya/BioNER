## Named Entity Recognition in Biomedical Corpus
In recent years, deep contextual embeddings such as (BERT, FLAIR, ELMO) have proved to be competent enough to detect the exact spans of named entities (both in general English Domain and Biomedical Domain. In this task, we aim to address the gaps of detecting named entities using both context-independent word embeddings and context-dependent word embeddings on the NCBI Disease, BC5CDR and ChemProt Corpus.
